# Experience-Plugin-Pwnagotchi

A totally not useful plugin for the Pwnagotchi, making it getting expierence everytime he Associate, Deauth or get an Handshake, try to level him up!

Wanted to make him more like a Tamagotchi, but moved that idea on another project.

Im a total newb when it comes to Python so, feel free to help if you see im doing som ebad stuff or you got some interesting ideas

Thanks to @mbudget0x01 for all the cool stuff!

## Things to do
  
- [x] Better Save System -> Saves are now in json Format and will per default migrate.
  
- [x] Make him count how many Handshake you have already captured and try to make a fair level up if you not starting from zero and you just installed the plugin [Example: if i already have 250 Handshake when i start the plugin for the first time, my Pwnagotchi will only be lv 1, while it should be lv 13(?)] -> if session-stats Plugin is installed, initially the data will be parsed from there. If not, just the last session will be counted.

- [ ] Make Things configurable through settings.

- [ ] Testing, lots of testing.
