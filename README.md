# Experience-Plugin-Pwnagotchi

A totally not useful plugin for the Pwnagotchi, making it getting expierence everytime he Associate, Deauth or get an Handshake, try to level him up!

Wanted to make him more like a Tamagotchi, but moved that idea on another project.

Im a total newb when it comes to Python so, feel free to help if you see im doing som ebad stuff or you got some interesting ideas

-Things to do:
  -Better Save System
  -Make him count how many Handshake you have already captured and try to make a fair level up if you not starting from zero and you just installed the plugin [Example: if i already have 250 Handshake when i start the plugin for the first time, my Pwnagotchi will only be lv 1, while it should be lv 13(?)]
